# Remote Work List for Developers

A starter list of job boards and websites for nomadic developers to look for freelance work. You can find the list in the CSV file: 

[remote-working-resources.csv](https://github.com/georgemandis/remote-working-list/blob/master/remote-working-resources.csv)

Created and curated by [George Mandis](https://george.mand.is).

## Pull Requests

You're more than welcome to make pull requests. Each listing should have:

- **Title**: The name of the website
- **Feed**: A yes/no indicator if there is an RSS/JSON feed available
- **URL**: The URL for the website
- **Notes**: Anything else worth mentioning (optional)

Here are some future changes I'd love to see:

- Direct links to the RSS/JSON feeds provided
- Notes on what may or may not need to be changed on the site to optimize it for remote-friendly job results
- Add taxonomies for better organization. For example, the WordPress-specific sites might not be relevant to everyone
- Provide a complimentary OPML file that can be imported into a feed reader, or perhaps a build script that would generate one based on the CSV
