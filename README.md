# Remote Work List for Developers

A starter list of job boards and websites for nomadic developers to look for freelance work. You can find the list in the CSV file:

[remote-working-resources.csv](https://github.com/georgemandis/remote-working-list/blob/master/remote-working-resources.csv)

Currently there are over 60 sites with remote job listings! Many of them have RSS feeds available as well.

Created and curated by [George Mandis](https://george.mand.is).

## Pull Requests

You're more than welcome to make pull requests! Each listing should have:

- **Title**: The name of the website
- **URL**: The URL for the website, preferably the landing page where jobs are actually listed
- **Feed URL**: A link to the primary RSS or JSON feed for job listings
- **Notes**: Anything else worth mentioning including: optional URL parameters for feeds, other means to subscribe if no feed is present, other limitations or specificty in jobs posted (optional)


## Future Changes

Here are some future changes I'd love to see and discuss:

- Add taxonomies for better organization. For example, the WordPress-specific sites might not be relevant to everyone
- Provide a complimentary OPML file that can be imported into a feed reader, or perhaps a build script that would generate one based on the CSV
- Organize the job sites into specific categories
- Provide a separate list (?) for job networks that require sign-up to join or where freelancers and remote-workers create profiles to advertise themselves to organizations looking to hire.
